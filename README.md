# Data-Cleaning-using-SQL.
In this project, the focus was to carry out a complete data cleaning of the Housing Dataset obtained in Kaggle.
The raw housing data was transformed using structured query language (SQL), making it easier for analysis to be carried out with it.

The various cleaning carried out on this dataset includes; standardizing the date format, populating the property adress data, breaking out addresses into individual columns etc.
